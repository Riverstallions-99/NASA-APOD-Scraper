# Version Info
# webScraper1 was the first inception of the idea, it just did the bare minimum
# webScraper2.0 was the next iteration ( I also upgraded chrome to firefox due to functionality and support); it could look back in time to check for old images, it wasn't pretty but it worked... just
# webScraper3.0 is the culmination of what I learned this session; datetime formats, objects that-are-also-dates and functions defined in a seperate file
# wS3.0 is the most efficient, as the function is defined once and used twice, and there are user options, so as to not even run the second time if not needed
# wS3.0 is also super simple to understand what is going on, it hides all the complexity behind a class which could be private
